# Typing Speed Test

## Description
The Typing Speed Test is a web application designed to help users enhance their typing skills by measuring typing speed in words per minute (WPM). This version of the project was specifically created for GitHub Pages and features the test text:

"The Chihuahuan raven, or Corvus cryptoleucus, is an intriguing bird known for its striking appearance and intelligence. This raven features a distinctive white patch on its neck and is native to the arid regions of western North America, particularly the Chihuahuan Desert. Highly adaptable, it thrives in various habitats and exhibits remarkable problem-solving skills, often using tools and collaborating with others. With a diet that includes insects, small mammals, and carrion, the Chihuahuan raven plays an essential role in its ecosystem by controlling pest populations and cleaning up the environment."

Users can easily start the test, type the provided text, and receive instant feedback on their performance, including the time taken and their typing speed.

In addition to this GitHub version, there is also a version of this same project available on GitLab, which utilizes a shorter test text. You can find that version at [https://short-typing-speed-test.corvuscryptoleucus.com](https://long-typing-speed-test.corvuscryptoleucus.com).
